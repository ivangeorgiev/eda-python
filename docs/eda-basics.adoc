

Command::

- Service asks another service to *do something*
- Usually synchronous
- There might be a response to the command - usually a success or failure indicator
- Calling service needs to know who handles the command


Query::

- Service asks another service for *data*
- There is always a response to the query, containing the data
- Retrieve data
- Almost always synchronous
- Calling service needs to know who handles the query


## Problems with commands and queries

- Performance
** synchronous
- Coupling
** calling service needs to know the handling service - to properly address it (discovery)
** changes to handling service API require changes to calling (client) service
** replacing the handling service require changes to client service
- Scalability
** client service is calling a single instance of a handling service
** if handling service instance is busy?
*** workaround with Load Balancing

## Event

* Indicates that *something happened* in the system
* There is *never a response* to an event

//-

Characteristics:

* Something happened
* Asynchronous by nature
* Never returns a response
* Calling service has no idea who handles the event


## Contents of Event

* Complete Event
** Contains all the relevant data
** Usually entity data
** No additional data is required for the event processing
* Pointer Event
** Contains pointer to the complete data of the Entity
** Complete data is usually stored in DB
** Event handler needs to access the DB to retreive complete data

When to use which?

* Complete Event
** Makes the event autonomous
** Can get out of the system boundaries - might not have access to DB

* Pointer Event
** When data is large
** Need to ensure data is up-to-date
*** Assuming DB is a single-source-of-truth


## Event Driven Architecture

- A software architecture paradigm that uses events as the mean of communication between services
- Three main components
** Producer
*** Component/Service sending the event
*** Usually sends event reporting somehing the component done
*** Examples:
**** Customer Service -> _New Customer Added_ event
**** Inventory Service -> _Item Sold Out_ event
*** Usually uses a dedicated SDK developed by the channel vendor
** Channel
*** The most important component in EDA
*** Responsible for *distributing* the events to the relevant parties
*** The channel places the event in a specialized queue, ofen called Topic or Fanout
*** Consumers listen to this queue and grab the event
** Consumer
*** The component that receives the event sent by the Producer and distributed by the Channel
*** Can be developed in any development language compatible with the Channel's libraries (if required)
*** Process the event
*** Sometimes reports back when processing is complete (ACK - acknowledgement)
*** Can get events using
**** push
**** pull


## Advantages of EDA

* Major problems with Command and Query:
** Performance
** Coupling
** Scalability
* Performance - Asynchronous architecture by nature
** The channel doesn't wait for response from the consumer
** No performance bottleneck/penalty
* Decoupled - producer has no idea who's listening to the the event
* Scalability - can scale (horizontally) by adding more consumers


## EDA vs Pub/Sub

Pub/Sub = Publish and Subscribe

Pub/Sub:
* 3 components
** Publisher
** Broker
** Subscriber
* A messaging pattern used by the system

EDA describes the whole architecture of the system

## Ordering in EDA

* Messaging engines often guarantee the order of the messages
** Traditional queue
* With EDA (especially Pub/SUb) - ordering is not always guaranteed
** Ordering might be affected by consumer latency, code performance and more
** If ordering is mandatory - use channel which supports it


## Orchestration and Choreography

EDA usually employs architecture style:

* Orchestration
** Flow of events in the system is determined by a central orchestrator
** Orchestrator receives output from components and calls the next component in the flow
** Next component sends the output back to the Orchestrator
** Services has no idea of the flow in the system; no idea about other services - autonomous, single responsibility
* Choreography
** Each component notifies about the status of events
** Other components listen to the events and act accordingly



## Event Sourcing and CQRS

* EDA is mainly about Services
* Events can be used as the basic building blocks of data too

### Problems with traditional DBs

* Hold data about current entity status
** SQL and NoSQL
* There is no way to see historical data of entities
* Data is a snapshot of a "point in time"

### Event Sourcing

* Data store pattern in which every change in the data is captured and saved
* Database stores list of changes for the entity, not the entity itself
* No updates or deletes, just inserts
* Every row documents a change in a property/ies of the entity
* The database is called *Event Store*

How can we view the current state of an entity? - Reply all events, related to the entity, starting from the first event.

Pros:

* Extremely easy to view historical data
* Simple database structure
* Simple database opperations (no updates, no concurrency) - very fast inserts

Cons:

* Viewing the current state is cumbersome and slow
* Large database capacity (many records per entity)


### CQRS

INFO: Command and Query Responsibility Segregation

- Separating commands (inserts/updates/deletes) from the queries (read)
- Each one of them in a separate database
- Commands DB is implemented as event store to improve performance and simplicity
- Queries database stores entities
- Databases are synced using a central synchronization mechanism
** Replay entities and create entity
** Update the Queries DB

Pros::
- Combines Event Sourcing pros with traditional entity query
- No performance penalty when querying entities

Cons::
- Entity data is not updated in real time - there is synchronization mechanism
- Difficult to setup and maintain


### When to use Event Sourcing and CQRS?

- When access to historical data is extremely important
** Regulation, finance, healthcare etc.
- When data is large and replying events is not feasible
- When peformance is critical (inserts or queries)
